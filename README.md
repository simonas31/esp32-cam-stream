## Intro

This project is used to establish connection between WiFi router and device through web interface.

After connecting to WiFi, register current device to ElderWatch website through API. Device registration will be visible right after connection was established.

Once connected, and device is registered, PIR sensor detects movements and sends captured images to Google Cloud Platform for later use.
